	The program that Prof.King gave as a hint or if one is stuck on the first Java Program wasn’t working and I was trying to figure out why.Thus,I went to the TA to ask why the program wasn’t running and he told me that I have to provide the argument.So after compiling, I added java Simple Trishala 2 and it worked.Furthermore,I was confused as to how to get the ASCII Art and he showed me that he wrote system.out.print.line by line.

	I used the ASCII Art of the 3 rows of glass bottles as the base for my ASCII Art, but I will be slightly modifying it to look more thinner and more like a Root beer glass bottle.

	I used this glass bottle as a model to change up the ASCII Art I got from the website above.
