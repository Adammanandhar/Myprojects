         I went to office hours to clarify the project and its purpose.Thus, she helped me start the project by using and modifying the Picture Library by using "for" loop and see what happens.This helped me a lot in getting started and understand the process of changing the color of different image files.

         I went to TA office hours because my picture had few red and blue dots, but the overall picture was grey, so I wasn't sure how to make it more transparent and the TA told me that my luminance has to be inside my "for" loop because the intensity of each color will change depending on the location of the pixel.

         I went to office hours today because I was confused how to get different color in different positions, but Prof.King suggested that I should first write code to see what I need to do to get one color for the whole width and length.Then,I had some trouble with running the program because the name of the image kept saying not found, but prof.King helped me understand that I need to create the image first by giving it width and height in the beggining of the code.Then, I also had trouble with my if statement regarding the brightness and she helped by pointing out that the strings need to have quotation marks.

         I went there because my system.exit for the error message wasn't working, but he told me that I need to put 1 or 0 in parenthesis after System.exit.

         I almost had the boolean expression for the if statement, but I had added an unnecessary line of brightness = true before my if statement, which caused both dim and bright to create bright image.
