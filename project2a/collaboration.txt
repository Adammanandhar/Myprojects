         I went to office hours to clarify the project and its purpose.Thus, she helped me start the project by using and modifying the Picture Library by using "for" loop and see what happens.This helped me a lot in getting started and understand the process of changing the color of different image files.

         I went to TA office hours because my picture had few red and blue dots, but the overall picture was grey, so I wasn't sure how to make it more transparent and the TA told me that my luminance has to be inside my "for" loop because the intensity of each color will change depending on the location of the pixel.

         I forgot the exact wordings to use to change any string to uppercase, so I went to this website to see how I do that.
