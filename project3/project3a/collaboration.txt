        I went to the office hours because I kept getting error where the terminal kept saying that it didn't recognize, this line, while (inFile.hasNextline()), of my code and the TA noticed that my "l" in line was in small letter and it was supposed to be in capital letter.Then, he also noticed that I didn't have a line in my while loop saying inFile.readLine(), so he told me I should add that in.I didn't have that line because I assumed it would just go to next line if it starts the while loop again.Lastly, he reminded me that I need to also have character.UNASSIGNED in the functionif the target wasn't found.
